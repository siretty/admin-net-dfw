NAME
  dfw-gen - generate rulesets for iptables
SYNOPSIS
  dfw-gen [-h] [-c|--cfg-file CFG_FILE]
DESCRIPTION
  dfw-gen generates iptables rulesets from rules files residing in multiple
  directories. They are categorized by table and chain and sorted lexically.

  If _no_ rules files exist, the default policies are chosen to allow all
  outbound connections, but forbid any inbound connections (including ping).

  The usual directory for configuration files is /etc/dfw. The default
  configurationfile is /etc/dfw/dfwrc, it's format is json.

  The directory layout of a rule directory (like /etc/dfw/rules.local.d) is
  * First-level directories are table names
  * Second-level directories are chain names

  Rule files are put into the second level directories (chain directories)
  * Only files with the ".rules" extension are considered as rules files.
  * If a ".rules" file is executable it is called with the table chain and
    file name as first, second and third command line argument, and it's
    output on stdout is used as a rules file.
  
  A rule file has the following format:
  * Lines starting with "#" (leading whitespace is ignored) are comments.
  * Empty lines or lines containing only whitespace are ignored.
  * All other lines are considered to be tables and are _copied_ to the
    resulting ruleset.
  * You must not prefix every rule with the table and chain name, these are
    automatically prepended, being taken from the directory layout.

  All specified rule directories (in the configuration file) are read,
  the rule files for a certain chain are sorted lexically.
OPTIONS
  -h      Display a short help message.
  -c      Use a specific configuration file instead of the default.
